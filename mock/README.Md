# Mock Directory

The `mock/` directory is dedicated to storing mock implementations for testing purposes. Mocks simulate the behavior of real components, enabling isolated and reliable testing of the application's functionality.

---

## Purpose

Mocks are used to:
- Replace real dependencies during testing to ensure tests are not affected by external factors (e.g., network issues, third-party service outages).
- Facilitate unit testing, integration testing, and behavior-driven development (BDD).
- Validate interactions with external systems without the need for live environments.

## Structure and Examples

```plaintext
mock/
├── platform/         # Contains mocks for platform-specific integrations
                      # (e.g., SMS, Kafka, SSO, or other external services).
