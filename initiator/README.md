# Initiator Directory

The `initiator/` directory is responsible for initializing and bootstrapping the entire application. It sets up critical components, ensuring all parts of the application are connected and ready to function.

---

## Purpose

The `initiator/` directory centralizes the initialization of:
- Handlers for processing client requests.
- Database connections and configuration.
- Modules that encapsulate business logic and services.
- The persistence layer that bridges the application and the database.

This directory ensures a seamless and modular startup process, adhering to clean architecture principles.

---

## Key Files and Their Roles

- **`handler.go`**: Initializes application handlers that process incoming requests.  
- **`db.go`**: Sets up and configures the database connection, ensuring secure and efficient data access.  
- **`module.go`**: Initializes modules containing business and service logic, enabling feature-specific functionality.  
- **`persistence.go`**: Sets up the persistence layer, which acts as an intermediary between the application and the database.

> **Note:** The *persistence layer* bridges the gap between the database and the application, ensuring smooth and structured data operations.

## `initiator.go`

The `initiator.go` file serves as the entry point for initialization:
- It ties all individual components together.
- Ensures dependencies are resolved in the correct order.
- Acts as the foundation for the application's runtime configuration.

> Think of `initiator.go` as the orchestrator where all the "magic" happensâ€”it ensures that the application starts up seamlessly with all necessary components properly initialized.

This structure ensures the application is modular, maintainable, and ready for extension or scaling.
